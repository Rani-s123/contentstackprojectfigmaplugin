Figma Plugin for Seamless Image-to-Design Conversion
This project was created for Contentstack's TechSurf Hackathon and includes three unique Figma plugins designed to streamline and elevate your design workflow:

Shape Generator: Instantly generate customizable shapes within Figma, providing a quick way to add geometric elements to your design.
Image-to-Figma Converter: Seamlessly transforms images into editable Figma elements, enabling smooth image-to-design conversion for a cohesive workflow.
Prompt-to-Figma Design Generator: Uses the RAG (Retrieval-Augmentation-Generation) model to generate designs based on user prompts, combining retrieved information with Figma’s tools for contextually accurate and data-informed designs.
To begin using these plugins, follow the setup instructions below. For more details on creating Figma plugins, check out the official Figma Plugin Quickstart Guide.

Prerequisites
Each plugin template is developed using TypeScript and NPM for optimized development. Here’s how to set up your environment:

Download Node.js (includes NPM) from this link.
Install TypeScript globally by running:
bash
Copy code
npm install -g typescript
Inside your plugin directory, install the latest Figma Plugin API type definitions:
bash
Copy code
npm install --save-dev @figma/plugin-typings
Why TypeScript?
TypeScript extends JavaScript with type annotations, enhancing code reliability by catching potential issues early and making development more intuitive, especially with Figma’s API. Learn more about TypeScript here.

Setting Up Your Development Environment
Download Visual Studio Code: Visual Studio Code Download.
Open your plugin directory in Visual Studio Code.
To compile TypeScript into JavaScript, go to Terminal > Run Build Task..., and select npm: watch. This command will automatically recompile your code on each save.
Plugin Details
Shape Generator: Quickly generates shapes within Figma, saving you time by automating geometric element creation.

Image-to-Figma Converter: Converts images into editable Figma layers, bringing external visuals seamlessly into your Figma project.

Prompt-to-Figma Design Generator: Powered by the RAG (Retrieval-Augmentation-Generation) model:

Retrieval: Pulls relevant information from a knowledge base to enrich the design context.
Augmentation: Combines retrieved data with Figma’s design capabilities.
Generation: Produces a Figma design based on the prompt, making it both contextually accurate and informed by real-time information.
